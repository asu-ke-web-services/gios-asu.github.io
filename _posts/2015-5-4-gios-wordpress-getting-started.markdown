The GIOS WordPress installation makes use of various plugins and themes to help writers and developers increase productivity.

These set of documents for GIOS WordPress will focus on how to use the WordPress installation as a whole, without focusing on what the plugins and themes are doing internally.

## Overview

The WordPress installation makes use of:

1. The Web Standards
2. The GIOS WordPress Plugin
3. Additional Plugins
4. Additional Themes

These themes and plugins enable you to:

1. Leverage the new Web Standards.
2. Customize your WordPress site.
3. Use new Page Templates for your WordPress Pages.
4. Create standardized menus.
5. Add relevant information and links to your footer. 
6. Leverage shortcodes in your pages and posts.
7. Have full-featured sections of your site enabled in seconds, such as News, Events, People, and Media!

## Plugin and Theme Ecosystem

In order to leverage all of these features, the following plugins and themes should be enabled for your site:

1. ASU Web Standards WordPress Theme
2. GIOS WP
3. Yoast Analytics
4. Yoast SEO

The ASU Web Standards WordPress Theme should either be activated, or a child theme of the ASU Web Standards Wordpress Theme should be activated.

The GIOS WP plugin is a private repository for use within GIOS.  This plugin has already been activated for you if you are using the MultiSite installation that GIOS provides.
