In addition to all of the components that [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) offers, the ASU Web Standards Bootstrap repo adds a few new components that you can use in your project.

### Lead Paragraphs

You can add what is known as a `lead paragraph` to your content.  Lead paragraphs pop out and are slightly larger in font than normal paragraphs.

They normally follow headings and are one sentence long.

<p class="lead">This is an example lead sentence</p>

```html
<p class="lead">This is an example lead sentence</p>
```

### Calendar Dates

Calendar dates are widgets that you can add to your application in order to allow users to visually see a date and download it to add the date to a calendar app of their choice.

<div class="calendar-date calendarPopover" data-original-title="" title="">
  <time datetime="2014-01-01">
    <span class="weekday">Sun</span>
    <span class="date">1</span>
    <span class="month">Jan</span>
  </time>
</div>

```html
<div class="calendar-date calendarPopover" data-original-title="" title="">
  <time datetime="2014-01-01">
    <span class="weekday">Sun</span>
    <span class="date">1</span>
    <span class="month">Jan</span>
  </time>
</div>
```
