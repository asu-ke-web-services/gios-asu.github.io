The GIOS WordPress mutlisite gives you access to a few page templates that should be used correctly throughout your WordPress site.  A couple of the page templates are only used for specific pages and should not be used elsewhere.  Specifically, the following templates should only be used on certain pages:

* Events Default Template
* News Default Template

The rest of the templates are detailed as follows:

## Containered Template

The containered template wraps your content in a `<div class="container">` element.  This will set it up so that you can quickly add columns and your copy to the page.  For more control over how your page looks, we recommend using the Full Width Template.

## Full Width Template

The full width template does not wrap your content in any markup that will change the layout.  It is up to you to add containers and columns to layout your page.
