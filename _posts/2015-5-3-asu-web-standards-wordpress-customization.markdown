New customization settings have been added to this theme. They are available by going to `Appearance -> Customize`.

## School Information

A new section to the customize menu has been added labeled `School Information`.  It contains the following settings that you can change:

### School Logo Full URL

This is the fully qualified URL that points to the white on transparent school logo.

### Parent Organization

This is the Parent Organization title text (ex. `Julie Ann Wrigely Global Institute of Sustainability`) that will appear to the left of the site title, seperated by a pipe (`|`).

### Parent Organization URL

This is the URL (ex. `http://sustainability.asu.edu`) that the page will navigate to when users click on the Parent Organization title text.

### Campus Address

This is the campus that the school is at. When set to a valid option, the campus's address will appear in the Mega Footer. Valid options include:

```
Tempe
Polytechnic
Downtown Phoenix
West
Research Park
Skysong
Lake Havasu
``` 

### Phone Number

This is the phone number (ex. `(602)-123-1234`) that will appear at the bottom of the page in the footer.  The text entered will become a link, prepended by `tel:` so that the number is clickable on mobile devices.

### Fax Number

Similar to the phone number, this is the fax number (ex. `+11231234`) that will appear at the bottom of the page in the footer.  The text entered will become a link, prepended by `tel:` so that the number is clickable on mobile devices.

### Contact Us Email or URL

The Contact Us Email or URL can be either an email address (ex. `email@address.com`) or a URL to a Contact Us form (ex. `mysite.asu.edu/contact-us`).

If the Contact Us input is an email address, then Contact Us link will be prepended with `mailto:`, which will open up the user's default Email software if available with the `Send to` field auto-populated with th given email address.

If the Contact Us input is a URL, then the page will navigate to that URL when users click on the Contact Us link.

### Contact Us Email Subject (Optional)

This field only works if the Contact Us Email or URL is an email.

The Contact Us Email Subject (ex. `Request for Information about the School of Sustainability`) will append to the Contact Us link `?subject=X` where `X` is the value of this input encoded for urls.

This will auto-populate the `Subject` field in the user's default Email software.

### Contribute URL (Optional)

This is the URL (ex. `http://mysite.asu.edu/contribute`) that the Contribute button will go to.

If not given, the contribute button will not be created.
